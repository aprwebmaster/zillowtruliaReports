This amazing Telegraph Hill panoramic view property is directly across from Levi's Plaza. This property includes 3 parcels totaling 6,866 sq.ft. Currently 2 parcels zoned C-2, & 1 parcel zoned RH3. Fantastic development potential with 120 ft. of frontage on Sansome St. This property is part of the Waterfront Historic District and Telegraph Hill neighborhood association. Drawing for potential 7 lofts and 5 cottages totaling 22,000 sq.ft. or a 9,000 sq.ft. estate are included. Configuration of this property is the result of at one time being a rock quarry where much of the original stone for City Hall and developing the Waterfront came from. Any new development will require some engineering of the hillside as is normally required by City building dept. for sloped lots. Real estate here on Telegraph Hill is one of the most exclusive and desirable areas of San Francisco.
